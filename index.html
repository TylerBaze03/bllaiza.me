    <h2 class = "inline">Babel</h2>
    
    <p class = "paragraph">How is a story that good? Arknights story always been incredibly laid out and just peak from top to bottom, but how do you tie just about evertyhing from basically the start of the game to the into the neat yarn ball that is Babel? So many answers along with just about as many questions to replace the old ones, also extremely exciting to see where Arknights:Endfield takes the story; I can only imagine it just builds on this as the most fascinating part of it is that in Endfield Oripathy is cured, or as they put it no longer an issue. This can both be conforting and worrying but especially with how the last couple of chapters of Babel were laid out. I wonder what this means for the doctor and what his original plan was regarding everything he did in the event. I really havent been this engrossed in a story since FFXIV and I'm very happy to have that same spark again for wanting to learn everything about the world and intracacies of the world given to us by Hypergrph. Endfield I assume will give many answers as well as the resolution of the Victoria arc, which I assume is reaching its penultimate number.</p>

    <p class = "ps">It always baffles me how people think gacha stories are useless, this is possibly one of the best stories I have ever readl, which is why I will never stop playing and enjoying live service games. :p</p>

    <h2 class = "inline">Lookback</h2>
    
    <p class = "paragraph"> This movie really did it for me, I mean man it just captured to manga so so good and I really dont know if I've ever been more excited to actually go an see something before. Been waiting almost a year to see it and it was totally worth it, especially the interview with the director Kiyotaka Oshiyama at the end of the film screening. I think i was trying to hold back crying like 5 minutes into the movie probably just from excitement and the anticipation fo what was to come, and the ending just destroys me everytime. Lookback really makes me think of the who am I doing this all for,and I think thats a good question to ask yourself sometimes as I think we all have someone, even if they're not here anymore, they we're creating or putting lots of effort in for. I know I have my own friend I've had for so long who I beleive, even if they were to leave and never come back again, id still be trying to create and make thing for as they really inspire me just like Fujina had.   
    </p>
    <p class = "paragraph"> I hope as many people as possible are able to watch it, even if the story is quite sad, you really can have so many different perceptions of what this story means and I think thats what Fujimoto did so well in all his oneshots and what Oshiyama was able to capture so well with his adaptaion of Lookback. I'm very glad Iw as able to see it in the theater i hope they make an adapdation of Sayonara, Eri with the same love and passion put into Lookback.

    <p class = "ps">Oh yeah I also started Arknights and Honkai Starrail a bit ago I'll probably add it to the contact me section cus I need friends :3</p>

    <h2 class = "inline">Cipher</h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">This is a Hills cipher I made for a security in computing class. Pretty cool, all you need is 2 files 1 with a key 1 with the message inside of it in order for it to run. All done in python using numpy mostly. If you'd like to download it and try, I'll include some tes files to put it in. All you need to do is navigate to it in the command prompt than run it in the form:  "py hillscypher.py k#.txt p#.txt" and it should print out the encoded message for you. You can also try and edit some of the keys and files that contain messages to encode as I did.</p>

    <p class = "paragraph"> Pretty much all for this entry, pre-ordered dawntrail and just sitting around waiting for any new news to come out on it really. Seems like a good release time for most people I know so week 1 stuff should go well, assuming no unexpected issues arise last minute. I'll maybe try and make it so I can run one of my simpler programs in the site itself so you wont have to download it and run it yourself. Not sure if i can do that with python or I'll have to recode it in javascript but I'm, sure theres a way. Anyways, pretty much all for this entry hope you like the Hills Cipher.
